"""
ParaView MCP server engine (v3, single-tool execute_code).

Unlike v1/v2 (which share the tool set defined in ``paraview_mcp.tools``),
v3 defines its **own** ``FastMCP`` instance and exposes a **single** tool:
``execute_code``. Like v2 it serves over MCP streamable-http and binds to a
configurable host/port (the MCP transport address).

v3 is **self-contained and stateless**: each ``execute_code`` call spawns its
own short-lived ``pv_runner.py`` (under ``pvpython``) which **listens** for a
reverse connection, then spawns a single-client ``pvserver`` in
**reverse-connection mode** which dials back to the runner on ``localhost``.
The supplied code runs in the runner, all output is captured, and both
processes are torn down again. The caller does **not** need to start
``pvserver`` manually for v3, and there is **no** persistent pipeline state
between calls (each call starts from a blank ParaView session).

Reverse-connection mode is used (server dials client) rather than forward mode
(client dials server) because ``pvserver`` advertises/binds on the machine's
system hostname rather than ``localhost``; a forward ``Connect`` to
``localhost`` is refused for ParaView's entire connect-retry window, which
deadlocks every call. In reverse mode the runner listens on ``localhost`` and
the server is told to dial back there via ``--client-host=localhost``.

Usage:
1. Point an MCP streamable-http client at the bound host:port (default
   http://localhost:8080/mcp).
